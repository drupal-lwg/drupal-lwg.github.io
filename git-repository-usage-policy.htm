<h2>General</h2>
<p>This is a free service provided by the Drupal developers for the Drupal community. <strong>By using the repository you agree to the terms of services</strong> (see below).</p>
<ul>
  <li>All PHP code committed to Drupal.org's git repository is licensed as GPLv2 and later (often abbreviated “GPLv2+”). This means that the code is licensed under GPLv2, and there exists an option that allows downstream recipients to re-license the code to be under a later version of GPL.</li>
  <li>All PHP and JavaScript should comply to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards">coding standards</a>.</strong> Any patch or pull request that fails to do this will generally be treated as unfinished work.</li>
  <li>All code downloaded from Drupal.org is distributed as GPLv2+ and includes this license. Any permissively licensed 3rd party PHP code that allows relicensing is automatically relicensed and distributed as GPLv2+ when the code is granted an exception by the LWG to be included in Drupal.org's Git repository.</li>
  <li>Any third party materials you include must have their provenance, license and source documented in a file included in the project.</li>
  <li>The "and later" clause in the Drupal GPLv2+ license allows anyone to distribute a derivative work (i.e. a version of Drupal core, modules, themes) linked to a library under a license compatible with a later version of GPL, such as GPLv3. Distribution of such derivative works is not allowed from Drupal.org.</li>
</ul>
